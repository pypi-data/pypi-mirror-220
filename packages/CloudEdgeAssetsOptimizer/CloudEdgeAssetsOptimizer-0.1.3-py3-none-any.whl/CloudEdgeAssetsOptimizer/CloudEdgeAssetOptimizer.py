#
#       CloudEdgeAssetsOptimizer is a software tool designed to evaluate and 
#   optimize the assets within a Cloud and Edge computing network. Its primary 
#   purpose is to provide insights and estimations to ensure efficient resource
#   allocation and decision-making. 
#       The developed software simulates the queues in Cloud and Edge devices, 
#   providing waiting times, battery consumption of Edge devices, and Servers' 
#   load. With a fore mentioned parameters available, valuable insights 
#   for decision-making can be obtained to optimize the network. Alternatively 
#   automated optimization can be performed using the embedded functions. 
#       CloudEdgeAssetsOptimizer aims to optimize operational efficiency, 
#   enhance resource utilization, and ultimately improve overall system 
#   performance. 
#       CloudEdgeAssetsOptimizer functions utilize queueing theory principles, 
#   therefore it also enables users to explore and fine-tune system parameters 
#   across diverse domains,including telecommunication networks, transportation
#   and manufacturing systems.
