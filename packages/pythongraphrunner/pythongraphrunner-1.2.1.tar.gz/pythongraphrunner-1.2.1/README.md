# Python Graph Runner
This project is a really simple piece of code that runs code in response to state transitions in a simple finite state machine. I built it due to this model being useful to represent a lot of tasks inolving scraping, automated builds and related things, and I made it public in case anyone wants to use it.

I'm not really going to actively maintain this, it's going to behave more like a Gist where you can take code from this repo and use it, or install the package.
