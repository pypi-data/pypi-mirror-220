# Run a workflow
run = sdk.workflows.run('workflow-id', {
    "input_field_name1": $input_value1,
    "input_field_name2": $input_value2
    // Input fields depends on the workflow you run, please look at our full documentation.
})

# Get a workflow run
workflow_run = sdk.workflowRuns.get(run['id'])

# List all workflow runs
workflow_run = sdk.workflowRuns.list()

print(workflow_run)
```
