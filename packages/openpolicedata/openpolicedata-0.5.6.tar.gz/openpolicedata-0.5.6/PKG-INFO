# OpenPoliceData
OpenPoliceData is a Python library that provides easy access to 365 (and growing) incident-level open datasets for over 4000 police agencies around the United States. Datasets include traffic stops, use of force, officer-involved shootings, complaints, and other types of police interactions. 

Users request data by department name and type of data, and the data is returned as a pandas DataFrame. There is no need to manually find the data online or to know how to work with open data APIs (ArcGIS, Socrata, etc.).

## Installation
The source code is available at https://github.com/openpolicedata/openpolicedata.

OpenPoliceData can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI):
```
pip install openpolicedata
``` 

Additionally, [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html) can be installed to enable downloaded data tables to be returned as geopandas DataFrames instead of pandas DataFrames when there is geographic data. It is recommended to use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install geopandas.

## Examples
**Not ready to code or only looking for a single dataset? Checkout our [OPD Explorer Streamlit App](https://openpolicedata.streamlit.app/)!**

**You can try out OpenPoliceData and run examples online on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/openpolicedata/opd-examples/HEAD).**

Basic usage of OpenPoliceData simply involves:
1. Finding datasets
2. Loading datasets

The query function is used to find data. To get all available datasets, query can be used with no inputs. To get all police stops datasets in Virginia, try the following:
```
> import openpolicedata as opd
> datasets = opd.datasets.query(state="Virginia", table_type="STOPS")
> datasets
```
| **State**  | **SourceName** | **Agency** | **TableType** | **coverage_start** | **coverage_end** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Virginia | Dumfries        | Dumfries          | STOPS | 2021-07-01    | 2023-03-31
| Virginia | Virginia    | MULTIPLE      | STOPS | 2021-07-01    | 2023-03-31

(only 1st 6 columns shown above)

There are 2 stops (containing pedestrian and traffic stops) datasets in Virginia: 1 for the town of Dumfries and 1 for every police department in Virginia (indicated by Agency being MULTIPLE). Let's load in data from the state data with `load_data_from_url`. To do this, we will first need to create a `Source`:

```
> src = opd.Source("Virginia")
```
If we are only interested in data from a single police department, we will need to set the optional agency input for load_data_from_url if we do not want to load data from all police departments in the state. `get_agencies` can be used to find the exact department name (if it is not known) by searching for agencies containing the `partial_name` input ("Arlington" in this case).
```
> agencies = src.get_agencies(table_type="STOPS", partial_name="Arlington")
> agencies
["Arlington County Sheriff's Office", 'Arlington County Police Department']
```
Now, we are ready to load the data.
```
> tbl = src.load_from_url(year=2021, table_type="STOPS", agency="Arlington County Police Department")
> tbl.table.head(n=3)
```

| **incident_date**  | **agency_name** | **agency** | **reason_for_stop** | **race** | **ethnicity** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| 2021-01-01 | Arlington County Police Department        | ARLINGTON CO          | OTHER | WHITE    | HISPANIC    |
| 2021-01-01 | Arlington County Police Department    | ARLINGTON CO      | EQUIPMENT VIOLATION | WHITE    | NON-HISPANIC    |
| 2021-01-01 | Arlington County Police Department    | ARLINGTON CO      | TRAFFIC VIOLATION | BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN    | NON-HISPANIC    |

(only 1st 6 columns shown above)

`tbl.table` is a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) and therefore, can be analyzed directly in Python using the powerful [pandas analysis library](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Alternatively, the table can be exported to a CSV file to analyze with your favorite tool:

```
> tbl.to_csv()
```

More examples can be found in the [opd-examples](https://github.com/openpolicedata/opd-examples) repo.

## Import
```
> import openpolicedata as opd
```

## Querying Available Data
### opd.datasets.query(source_name=None, state=None, agency=None, table_type=None)
Query the available datasets to see what is available. Various filters can be applied. By default, all datasets are returned.
```
> datasets = opd.datasets.query(state="California")
> datasets.head()
```
| **State**  | **SourceName** | **Agency** | **TableType** | **Year** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| California | Anaheim        | Anaheim          | TRAFFIC STOPS | MULTI    |
| California | Bakersfield    | Bakersfield      | TRAFFIC STOPS | MULTI    |
| California | California     | MULTI            | STOPS         | 2018     |
| California | California     | MULTI            | STOPS         | 2019     |
| California | California     | MULTI            | STOPS         | 2020     |

(only 1st 5 columns shown above)

datasets is a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). The first 5 datasets available from California include traffic stops data from multiples years from Anaheim and Bakersfield and data from every agency in California for all types of police stops for years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

### opd.datasets.summary_by_table_type(by_year=False)
Returns a pandas DataFrame with the number of datasets available for each type of table (stops, use of force, etc.). Setting `by_year` to True also returns a breakdown of table types by year.

### opd.datasets.get_table_types(contains=None)
Returns types of tables available in OpenPoliceData. If `contains` is not None, only table types containing `contains` are returned.

### opd.datasets.num_sources(full_states_only=False)
Returns the number of sources (police departments and states) that provide the data available in OpenPoliceData. Setting `full_states_only` to True returns only the number of states that share data for all agencies in the state.

### opd.datasets.summary_by_state(by=None)
Returns a pandas DataFrame with the number of datasets available for each state. The optional input `by` can be used to further breakdown by "year" or "table".

### opd.datasets.summary_by_table_type(by_year=False)
Returns a pandas DataFrame with the number of datasets available for each type of table (stops, use of force, etc.). Setting `by_year` to True also returns a breakdown of table types by year.

## Loading and Working with Datasets
### opd.Source(source_name, state=None)
Create a data source. A data source allows the user to easily import or export police data. It provides access to all datasets available from a source. `source_name` should match a value of SourceName for an available dataset. An optional `state` parameter is used to resolve ambiguities when the same source name is used in multiple states (such as multiple states have State Police).
```
> src = opd.Source(source_name="Virginia")
> src.datasets
```
| **State**  | **SourceName** | **Agency** | **TableType** | **Year** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| Virginia   | Virginia       | MULTI            | STOPS         | MULTI    |

(only 1st 5 columns shown above)

There is 1 dataset available from the state of Virginia that contains data from every agency in Virginia for all types of police stops for multiple years.

### get_tables_types()
Show all types of data available from a source.
```
> src.get_tables_types()
['STOPS']
```

### get_years(table_type=None, force=False)
Show years available for one or more datasets. Results can be filtered to only show years for a specific table type. For CSV and Excel data types, get_years will not run unless force is set to True due to the necessity of reading in the entire file. It may be more efficient to run load_from_url and manually get the years.
```
> src.get_years(table_type="STOPS")
[2020, 2021, 2022]
```

### get_agencies(table_type=None, year=None, partial_name=None)
Show agencies (police departments) that have data available. This is typically a single agency unless the data is from a state. Results can be filtered to only show agencies for a specific type of data and/or year. `partial_name` can be used to find only agencies containing a substring. This is useful for finding the exact name of a police department.
```
> agencies = src.get_agencies(partial_name="Arlington")
> print(agencies)
['Arlington County Police Department', "Arlington County Sheriff's Office"]
```

### get_count( year=None, table_type=None, agency=None, force=False)
Get the number of records that would be returned for a table. `table_type` and `year` can be used to filter for a specific table. For datasets that allow for filtering by agency, the number of records can be requested for a specific agency by setting `agency`. For the Excel data type, get_count will not run unless force is set to True due to the necessity of reading in the entire file. It may be more efficient to run load_from_url and then to find the number of rows of the returned table.

### load_from_url(year, table_type=None, agency=None, pbar=True, nrows=None, offset=0)
### load_from_url_gen(year, table_type=None, agency=None, pbar=False, nbatch=10000, offset=0, force=False)
Load data from the source. 
* load_from_url returns the entire data request at once as a DataFrame
* load_from_url_gen returns a generator for batch processing

Data for a year (i.e. 2020) or a range of years (i.e. [2020, 2022]) can be requested. If more than one data type is available, `table_type` must be specified. Optionally, for datasets containing multiple agencies (police departments) data, `agency` can be used to request data for a single agency. `pbar` can be set to false to not show a progress bar while loading. `offset` indicates the starting record in the data request. `nrows` is the total number rows to request. For example, to request records 10 to 30, `offset` would be 10 and `nrow` would be 20. `offset` and `nrows` allow requesting of data in batches. For load_from_url_gen, `nbatch` is the size of the batch read returned each iteration.
```
> agency = "Arlington County Police Department"
> tbl = src.load_from_url(year=2021, table_type="STOPS", agency=agency)
> tbl.table.head(n=3)
```

| **incident_date**  | **agency_name** | **agency** | **reason_for_stop** | **race** | **ethnicity** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| 2021-01-01 | Arlington County Police Department        | ARLINGTON CO          | OTHER | WHITE    | HISPANIC    |
| 2021-01-01 | Arlington County Police Department    | ARLINGTON CO      | EQUIPMENT VIOLATION | WHITE    | NON-HISPANIC    |
| 2021-01-01 | Arlington County Police Department    | ARLINGTON CO      | TRAFFIC VIOLATION | BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN    | NON-HISPANIC    |

(only 1st 6 columns shown above)

```
> for tbl in src.load_from_url_gen(year=2021, table_type="STOPS", agency=agency, nbatch=1000):
      df = tbl.table.copy()
      # Do something with the 1000 row DataFrame that was loaded
```

The result of load_from_url is a Table object. The table contained in the Table object is either a [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html) or [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) DataFrame depending on whether the returned data contains geographic data or not.

### to_csv(output_dir=None, filename=None)
Export table to CSV. The default output directory is the current directory. The default filename is automatically generated which enables the user to easily re-import the table to a new Table object.
```
> tbl.to_csv()
```
### load_from_csv(year, output_dir=None, table_type=None, agency=None)
Import table from previously exported CSV. The directory to look in defaults to the current directory. The CSV file must have been automatically generated (see [to_csv](#tocsvoutputdirnone-filenamenone)). `year`, `table_type`, and `agency` are defined the same as for [load_from_url](#loadfromurlyear-tabletypenone-agencyfilternone).
```
> new_src = opd.Source(source_name="Virginia")
new_t = new_src.load_from_csv(year=2021, agency=agency)


> tbl.table.head(n=3)
```
