 :alt: Coverage Status

A SpiNNaker machine management application which manages the partitioning and
allocation of large SpiNNaker machines into smaller fragments for many
simultaneous users.

This package just contains a server which exposes a simple TCP interface to
clients to enable them to request hardware.

The `documentation <https://spalloc-server.readthedocs.org/>`_ describes the
process of configuring and running servers, the simple JSON-based client
protocol and an overview of the server's implementation.
