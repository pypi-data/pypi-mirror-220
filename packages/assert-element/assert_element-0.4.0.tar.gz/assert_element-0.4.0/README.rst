Simple TestCase assertion that finds element based on it's path and check if it equals with given content.

This is more useful than the default Django AssertContains
because it will find the element and show differences if something changed.
The test also tries to ignore differences in whitespaces as much as possible.

Other similar projects
----------------------

I released this package just to realize after few days, that there are some other very similar projects:

* https://pypi.org/project/django_html_assertions/
* https://django-with-asserts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* https://github.com/robjohncox/python-html-assert

Documentation

The full documentation is at https://assert_element.readthedocs.io.

Quickstart
----------

Install by:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install assert-element

Usage in tests:

.. code-block:: python

    from assert_element import AssertElementMixin

    class MyTestCase(AssertElementMixin, TestCase):
        def test_something(self):
            response = self.client.get(address)
            self.assertElementContains(
                response,
                'div[id="my-div"]',
                '<div id="my-div">My div</div>',
            )

The first attribute can be response or content itself.
Second attribute is the path to the element.
Third attribute is the expected content.
