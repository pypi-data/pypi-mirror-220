# Eriparse

*HTML parsing logic for `https://www.erieri.com/cost-of-living-calculator`. Was written to help my wife and I better understand the differences between potential cities for her fellowship.*


#### Notes
Be aware that website frontend can change _whenver_, so, rely on the build badge above for is_still_valid to know whether the website HTML has changed.
