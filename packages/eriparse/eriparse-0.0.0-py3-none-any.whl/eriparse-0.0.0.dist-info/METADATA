# Eriparse
![is_still_valid_workflow](https://github.com/ncgl-git/eriparse/actions/workflows/is_still_valid.yaml/badge.svg)

*HTML parsing logic for `https://www.erieri.com/cost-of-living-calculator`. Was written to help my wife and I better understand the differences between potential cities for her fellowship.*
