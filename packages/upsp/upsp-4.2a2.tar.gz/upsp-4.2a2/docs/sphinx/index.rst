Unsteady Pressure-Sensitive Paint (uPSP) Data Processing Software
=================================================================

The ``upsp`` package consists of a suite of applications for processing
high-speed video files from fast-response, pressure-sensitive paint
camera systems. It also provides a Python API for developers to
extend and modify functionality. The software is maintained by NASA
and used as part of several uPSP systems deployed at its small- and large-scale wind tunnel
test facilities.

:numref:`sls-screenshot` shows one frame of a video animation of the pressure-time history produced
by the uPSP software for a test event at the NASA Ames 11-ft transonic wind tunnel
of the Space Launch System (SLS) Block 1B crew configuration (`source <https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220005639>`_).
