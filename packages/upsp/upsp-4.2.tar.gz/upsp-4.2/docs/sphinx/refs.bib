	abstract = {The flow-induced pressures generated by turbulent boundary layers cause vibration and, ultimately, sound. The convected nature of the pressures has led to considerable sophistication in the mathematical modeling of boundary-layer-induced vibration and sound. The work in this general area has been applied, and is of direct importance, to the prediction and reduction of cabin noise in aircraft fuselages and automobile interiors, the vibration of reentry vehicles, sound in sonar domes, and vibrations and sound generated in pipes and ducts. This chapter will develop various ways of describing the forcing function, discussing the nature of the cross-spectral and wave vector properties of surface pressures generated by turbulent flow over smooth or rough surfaces that relate to the production of sound and vibration.},

	abstract = {Phased arrays of pressure transducers have found broad application in both airborne and underwater acoustic technology. This chapter examines several examples of the responses of transducers, transducer arrays, and elastic structures to wave number-distributed turbulent boundary layer wall pressures and diffuse sound. The responses of planar surfaces in air with minimum fluid loading, fluid-loaded panels, and surfaces made of elastomeric materials are all discussed. This chapter also considers both rough and smooth wall boundary layers and incident acoustic fields as notionally occurring with an elastic panel in the wall of a reverberant chamber.},
