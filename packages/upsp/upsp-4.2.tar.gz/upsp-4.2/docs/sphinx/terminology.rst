Terminology
===========

-  **Data point**: A single wind tunnel test condition
-  **External calibration**: Also called “extrinsic” calibration;
   parameters that quantify the position and orientation of a camera
   coordinate frame relative to another frame (for example, relative to
   a test model-fixed frame or a wind tunnel-fixed frame)
-  **Internal calibration**: Also called “intrinsic” calibration;
   parameters that quantify the physical properties of the camera system
   such as focal length and sensor center offset.
-  **Javascript Object Notation (JSON)**: Text-based file format used
   for storage of structured data, used throughout uPSP software for
   configuration files.
-  **Outer Mold Line (OML)**: The wetted surface area of an aerodynamic
   body (to be painted with PSP)
-  **NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS)**: Division at NASA
   Ames Research Center that houses the HECC.
-  **Pleaides Front End (PFE)**: Systems in the NAS HECC enclave for
   user login to interact with the HECC clusters.
-  **Portable Batch Scheduler (PBS)**: System service that handles
   scheduling jobs on NAS HECC clusters.
-  **Wind Tunnel Data (WTD) file**: File format for storage of wind
   tunnel test conditions such as Mach number, Reynolds number, model
   angle of attack, model sideslip angle, and model sting support
   position.
-  **Wind tunnel test model (“test model”, or “model”)**: The physical
   body installed in the wind tunnel for test purposes
-  **Wind tunnel test model grid (“model grid”, or “grid”)**: The 3D
   representation of a wind tunnel test model in a digital file format
