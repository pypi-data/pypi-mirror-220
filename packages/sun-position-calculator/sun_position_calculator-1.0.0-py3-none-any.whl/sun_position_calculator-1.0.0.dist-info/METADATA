# Sun Position Calculator:

The Sun Position Calculator is a Python library that provides a convenient way to calculate the azimuth and altitude of the sun for a given date, time, and location. It also allows you to determine various sun-related phases such as sunrise, sunset, dawn, dusk, and more based on different angles.

## Installation:

You can easily install the library via pip:

```bash
pip install sun-position-calculator
```

## Usage:

Example 1: Calculate Sun Position

```python
import math
from sun_position_calculator import SunPositionCalculator

# Replace the latitude and longitude with your desired location
latitude = 37.7749
longitude = -122.4194

# Replace the UNIX timestamp with the desired date and time
unixtime_in_ms = 1679795200000  # Example: 10th May 2023, 12:00 PM (UTC)

# Create an instance of the SunPositionCalculator
calculator = SunPositionCalculator()

# Calculate the sun position
position = calculator.pos(unixtime_in_ms, latitude, longitude)
azimuth = math.degrees(position.azimuth)
altitude = math.degrees(position.altitude)

print(f"Sun Azimuth: {azimuth:.2f} degrees")
print(f"Sun Altitude: {altitude:.2f} degrees")
```

Example 2: Find Time of Sunrise

```python
from sun_position_calculator import SunPositionCalculator, SunPhase

# Replace the latitude and longitude with your desired location
latitude = 37.7749
longitude = -122.4194

# Replace the UNIX timestamp with the desired date
unixtime_in_ms = 1679795200000  # Example: 10th May 2023, 12:00 PM (UTC)

# Create an instance of the SunPositionCalculator
calculator = SunPositionCalculator()

# Find the time of sunrise at the given location
sunrise_time = calculator.time_at_phase(unixtime_in_ms, SunPhase.sunrise(), latitude, longitude, height=0)

print(f"Sunrise time: {sunrise_time}")
```

## Getting Help:

So you need help.

People can help you, but first help them help you, and don't waste their time.

Provide a complete description of the issue.

If it works on A but not on B and others have to ask you: "so what is different between A and B" you are wasting everyone's time.

"hello", "please" and "thanks" are not swear words.
