           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Heterogeneous Files in Parallel File (hepfile)

In high energy physics, experiments require file formats that can accomodate
heterogeneity (each collection event can have differing amounts of data collected)
and size (since HEP experiments can generate petabytes of data). Although the current
file format of choice is ROOT, a file format developed by CERN, we believe that
HDF5, which is a portable and more commonly used file format outside of HEP,
has promise in being a new standard.

The only issue is that HDF5 works best with homogenous data formats, where each
dataset occupies an n by m chunk of memory. This is not necessarily the case
for HEP data, but we addressed this issue using an organizational method outlined
in our schema.

# Schema

### Heterogenous Data ...

We assume that data that we collect is composed of (insert some term for particle,
chair, etc.) each carrying a certain number of attributes. Each ___ is associated
with some increasing counter. In HEP, this counter is events. Each event can
have an arbitrary number of particles of any type, making this data heterogenous.

### ... to Homogenous File

To make this data homogenous, we can create n by m chunks of data for each type
of particle, where n is the total number of this particle in all of the events,
and the specific row for each of the particles contains all of the attributes
for that particle in the original data.

We also create a list for each type of particle whose length is the total number
of events. At position *i*, we have the data for how many particles of said type
appeared in event *i*.

# Overview of use case

`hepfile` is useful for datasets where there are n columns with different numbers
of rows. In more "pythonic" language, you can imagine a dictionary where each key
has a different number of values. For example:
```
   data = {x: [1],
           y: [1, 2],
	   z: ['1', '2', '3']
   }
```
This can not simply be converted to most common data structures, like a Pandas DataFrame,
or written to a simple homogeneous file structure, like a CSV file. In a more complex case
Let's have an image of a town, with cartoon people here.

To illustrate how to use hepfile with this example, we imagine a researcher conducting
a census on a town. Each household in the town has some variable number of people
in it, some variable number of vehicles, and only one residence. The people, vehicles,
and residence all have different data associated with them. How would we record
these data? Well, to first order, we might decide to record them in multiple spreadsheets or
multiple .csv files.

![](docs/images/household_example_spreadsheet_00_smaller.png)
![](docs/images/household_example_spreadsheet_01_smaller.png)
![](docs/images/household_example_spreadsheet_02_smaller.png)

One could also imagine this data stored in a database with each of the csv files as tables.
But the goal is to keep all of this data in one file, so that it is easier for someone to
do analysis. For example, someone might want to know the average number of people per bedroom,
in the homes. Or the average number of vehicles as a function of combined ages of the household
residents. If we have 3 separate files, this is more difficult to work with. What we want is one
file and a way to extract information, collected by *household*.

To do this, we need some way to count the number of people or vehicles in any household,
as well as keep track of what data fields will always have one entry per household (e.g. data
about the residence itself).

One could imagine building a very large [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/]) dataframe to do this
with a lot of join statements and then use `.groupby()` approach or to store this in a database and
then use a lot of SQL join statements. But we want to store this in a single file so. instead, we will
take our cue from ROOT and particle physicists, who are used to looping over subsets of their data.

# Installation
### User Installation
For non-developers, `hepfile` can be installed using `pip`.
`hepfile` includes some optional features that include optional dependencies so there are multiple
different options for installation.

The base package gives you the ability to read and write hepfiles using the more standard "loop & pack"
method and the dictionary tools. This is the "lightest" of the installation options and  is only dependent
on `numpy` and `h5py`. To install the base package use:
```
python -m pip install hepfile
```

You can also get the `awkward_tools` which is the hepfile integration with the awkward package. This is
especially recommended for High Energy Physicists who are used to working with awkward arrays. The only
dependency this add is `awkward`. To install this version of the package use:
```
python -m pip install hepfile[awkward]
```

You can get the more data science focused tools by installing the `df_tools` and `csv_tools`. These provide
integration with pandas and typical csv files. This is recommended for those who are used to working
with pandas in python. This adds a a `pandas` dependency to the base installation. To install this \
distribution use:
```
python -m pip install hepfile[pandas]
```

Finally, to get both the awkward and pandas integration with hepfile (which adds pandas and awkward
to the base installation dependencies) use:
```
python -m pip install hepfile[all]
```

The documentation for hepfile can be found at hepfile.readthedocs.io.

### Developer Installation
For local builds for testing follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the top-level directory of this project (probably called hepfile)
3. We then recommend installing with the developer dependencies. To do this run:
```
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```
4. Then, run the following command to setup the pre-commit git hook
to automatically run our code standard tests before committing!
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

As a side note, to test developments to the code use the following command in the top-level directory of
the project:
```
pytest
```
