## REPORTING BUGS

Report bugs opening an issue on the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara) where the development and maintenance is primarily done.  
Issues which are security relevant should be disclosed privately to the [Kathara mailing list](mailto:contact@kathara.org). You do not have to be subscribed to the list to send a message there.  
When reporting a bug, remember to write used commands, eventually attach your network scenario, and include the output of `kathara-check`(1) in order to make possible to reproduce the bug.
