# thermoblock

## About

Flux simulation toy building library.

## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install thermoblock
```


<!-- # Legacy Alart‼️
This repository is being renovated...! 🚧👷‍♂️ Coming soon!

# What can I do with this?

This program is for simulating the heat flux of solid stuff or any stuff...
It can be used for any material if the user updates some information of new material and make a form by an equation.
Users may calculate any flux if they modify the formula in the main module containing the physical engine.

You can adjust specific heat conductivity capacity and density to the material u made in the program. (or another physical character u need.)

The basic materials are iron and copper. Users can use the information of those two material. And User can add other information needed for simulation by the UI, or just typing in the program.


# Physical Idea of the Program.
The main idea is to split the solid into blocks like toy blocks 🧱 and calculate the flux between the blocks.

The calculating mechanism is defined as a method in the 'RObject' class which is the solid object consisting of the blocks.

The 'block' object is the unit object of the solid like a Lego block, each block in the solid has its own index.

So 'block' should have indices (a set of indexes in 3 dimensions) and the solid stuff, 'RObject' has a set of indices.
Users can make any object by equation of the object in 3D rectangular coordinates.
  **(I'm making the circular and spherical coordinate system too.)

The copper stick and the iron stick sample object are also in the main module, so the user can just try making it by command line with
```
  from mainmodule import *
  a = iron stick();
```
The sample object is just like an experiment material, which I used in the 'general physics experiment class' at my school.

# Setting up the environment

program language: python /
required module: numpy, vpython, tkinter

There is a `setup.sh` shell script for setting up the environment. I don't recommend this program for window user because it is very annoying to use vpython with window. 윈도우 극혐...
But there are many easy way to run the linux os in the window so user would be better to run the program in that way.

# Development progress situation

### List of functions I want to add to the program.
- multi-process (most important, since the process is too slow now...)
- fantastic UI
- equation editor

### UI
- user can choose the environment either 'open' or 'close'.
- there are two example simulations
      setting one end of the metal stick at 100℃ and one end of the metal stick, 0℃  and the other part is 20℃ .
- the UI is not working properly...

# Developer
It was just my homework in the visual physics course at my school...
My e-mail address is 'luysunyoung9@gmail.com'.
I'm studying at the dept. of physics at the University of Seoul. -->
