<p> This application is written in Python,
    with the help of the <a href="https://www.reportlab.com">ReportLab</a> library
    (the web part is powered by the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> framework).
    The code is open-source
    and is available here: <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>.
    The ability of this application to reproduce several figures (independently) published by the IPCC was
    carefully tested. However, this is not a product of the IPCC (which is
    not responsible for projects or researches).

<h1 class="nondoc">Development history</h1>
<p>
    Although the web application and layout details were improved over time, there is no change affecting the translation
    of the risk levels provided as input to colours in the burning embers. The changes are recorded on
    <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>
    (see <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a>).
    A short summary is provided below (from recent to old).
</p>

<h2>Recent news?</h2>
<p> When an update is planned, it might be announced on  <a href="https://climrisk.org">climrisk.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>2023/07: Addition of SVG output, support for non-standard transition names</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Addition of SVG as one of the available output formats (SVG is an open-standard
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">vector graphics format</a>).
    This format is also used for the screen preview.</li>
<li>Any transition name can be used provided that the included colors/risk levels are defined in the
"Color definitions" sheet of the Excel file provided as input.
    This may facilitate the inclusion of positive impacts of climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This update also fixes bugs and removes the requirement for the flask-session module.
    <br>(version 1.8.2)
</p>

<h2>2023/04: Support for detailed risk transitions, simplifications and corrections</h2>
<p>
    The update provides support for complex descriptions of transitions, which may involve one or both of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>risk transition ranges assessed for more than one confidence level (e.g. "it is likely that it will occur in
    this narrow range, but very likely that it will occur within that broader range").</li>
<li>more information about the hazard level that corresponds to a given risk level inside a
    "risk transition". The standard is min, (optional) median, max; the update adds the possibility to
    provide "percentiles", which are intermediate levels of risk within a transition: p25, p75, etc. (p50 would
    be the median).</li>
</ul>
<p> In addition, there is a minor bug fix, and: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The update simplifies the documentation by referring to the former "basic (file) format" as the standard
        format. The former "full-flex" format was probably used in a single case and is kept for legacy file(s).</li>
    <li>When non-numeric data is erroneously provided for a hazard level (within a transition), it will be converted
    to numeric with a warning. This typically results from entering "." instead of "," as the decimal separator.
        <b>Such erroneous lines were previously ignored.</b></li>
</ul>
    <p>(version 1.7.1)</p>
<h2>2021/09: Support for 'overlapping transitions', corrections for technical issues</h2>
<p> It is now possible to define 'overlapping transitions', i.e. generate embers with 'uncertainty ranges' that span
    across each other (e.g. it might be that risk is above or below 'high' at a given level).
    Technical changes enable files to be opened in recent versions of Adobe Illustrator (...).
    <br> (version 1.6)
</p>
<h2>2021/01: Additional layout options</h2>
<p> Optional secondary axis (on the right, typically with a different scale), minor tick marks
    (unlabelled ticks between the main axis ticks), tick marks instead of horizontal grid lines, legend for confidence
    levels (experimental).
    <br> (version 1.5)
</p>

<h2>2020/12: Improvements, full documentation of the parameters, bug fixes for specific cases</h2>
<p> File format download options (PDF/PNG/JPEG) are added. Cases where the vertical scale ('hazard') has limits significantly
    different from the usual "0 to +5Â°C", such as for CO2 concentrations in ppm, are now much better handled (bug fix).
    Coding improvements provide more clarity for future development. All parameters are documented in a way
    that is fully consistent with how they work (the same file provides online documentation and default values).
    <br> (version 1.4)
</p>

<h2>2020/08: Median value in the transitions and better handling of input file issues</h2>
<p> An optional median, or 'midpoint' between the start and end of each transition, is added in the 'Basic format'.
This results in the 'standard template' provided in the <a href="{{ url_for('.doc',subpage='tutorial')}}">Tutorial</a>.
    Input files containing missing data, errors, or other unexpected characteristics are better handled.</p>

<h2>2019/11 - 2020/05: Initial development</h2>
<p> This software was created by Philippe Marbaix at the end of 2019
    (based on an earlier 'AR5-related' back-of-the-envelope version).
    The first objective was to produce figure 3 of Zommers et al. (2020;
    <i>Burning Embers: Towards more transparent and robust climate change risk assessments</i>.
    Nature Reviews Earth & Environment. <a href="https://doi.org/10/gg985p">doi.org/10/gg985p</a>).<br>
</p>
<p> Help is welcome to further improve the application. All contributions will be recognised :-).
