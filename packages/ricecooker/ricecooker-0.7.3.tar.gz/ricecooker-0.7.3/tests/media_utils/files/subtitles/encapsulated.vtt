( clock ticking )

00:14.848 --> 00:17.000
MAN:
When we think
\u266a ...say bow, wow, \u266a

00:17.000 --> 00:18.752 align:right
we have this vision of Einstein

00:18.752 --> 00:20.887
&nbsp;
as an old, wrinkly man
with white hair.

00:20.887 --> 00:26.760
MAN 2:
E equals m c-squared is
not about an old Einstein.

00:26.760 --> 00:32.200
MAN 2:
It's all about an eternal Einstein.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.200
&lt;LAUGHING &amp; WHOOPS!>
