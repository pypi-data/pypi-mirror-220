In these notes we gives insight about joint parameter estimation in PINN
problems, i.e., we wish to estimate both the differential equation parameters
and its solution with a PINN. We use and specify notation from the previous
notes: this differential operator $\mathcal{N}[.]$ is now parameterized by the
equation parameters $\nu$ and the PINN $u$ is again parameterized by $\theta$.
Hence the dynamic loss equation becomes

``` math
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_{\nu}[u_{\theta}](t, x)=0.
\end{equation}
```

# Vanilla parameter estimation

A direct and quite successful approach has been proposed in _Physics-informed
neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse
problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations_, Raissi et al.,
2019. This procedure consists in a joint alternate minimization of the dynamic
loss with respect to $\nu$ and $\theta$,

``` math
\begin{equation}
\text{Alternate between }
$\hat{\nu}=\mathrm{argmin}_{\nu}\Vert\mathcal{N}_{\nu}[u_{\theta}](t,x)\Vert
\text{ and }
$\hat{\theta}=\mathrm{argmin}_{\theta}\Vert\mathcal{N}_{\nu}[u_{\theta}](t,x)\Vert,
\end{equation}
```

along with an additional mean square error term with respect to an available batch of
observations,

``` math
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{argmin}_{\theta} \sum_{i}(u_{\theta}(t_i,x_i) - u^{obs}(t_i,x_i))^2
\end{equation}
```

In some of our example notebooks we show how to perform joint estimation according to
this procedure.

# Vanilla parameter estimation + $\nu$ is fed in the PINN
TODO ?

# A full statistical model for parameter estimation
TODO ?
