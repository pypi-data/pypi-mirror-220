msgid "The overall structure is organized as follows:"

#: ../../contributing/structure.rst:28
msgid ""
"This structure allows developers to easily navigate and comprehend each "
"RFC specification individually. The code is organized from low-level to "
"high-level, making it intuitive and convenient to understand and use. "
"Developers can utilize the higher-level APIs (``jws.py``, ``jwe.py``, "
"``jwk.py``, ``jwt.py``) without needing to delve into the lower-level "
"implementation details."
