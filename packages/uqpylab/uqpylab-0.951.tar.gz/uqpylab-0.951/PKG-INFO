# UQ[py]Lab
UQ[py]Lab is the official python client of the UQCloud project, which aims at providing a cloud-based, language agnostic API to the [UQLab](https://uqlab.com) uncertainty quantification framework. 

While still officially in a "beta testing" stage, UQ[py]Lab is close to its first public stable release, scheduled for Summer 2023.

## Before you start

Because of its cloud-based nature, UQ[py]Lab requires an authentication token, which can be freely obtained by registering for beta testing at the UQ[py]Lab website: [https://uqpylab.uq-cloud.io](https://uqpylab.uq-cloud.io)

After registration, you will find all the information you need to connect to the UQCloud servers at your personal profile page on [https://uqpylab.uq-cloud.io](https://uqpylab.uq-cloud.io).

## Installation

To install the package in your local Python environment, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install uqpylab
```

**Notes**:

- UQ[py]Lab requires Python version >= 3.9
- It is highly recommended to install UQ[py]Lab in a new Python virtual environment

## First Steps

To get started with UQ[py]Lab, we strongly recommend new users to go peruse the following resources:
