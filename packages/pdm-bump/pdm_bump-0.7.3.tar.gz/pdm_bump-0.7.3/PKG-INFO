# pdm-bump

[![pdm-managed](https://img.shields.io/badge/pdm-managed-blueviolet)](https://pdm.fming.dev)

A small PEP440 compliant bump utility for PDM, the [Python Development Master](https://pdm.fming.dev/).

## Why?

As of PEP621, the pyproject.toml supports project metadata including a project version. If you are using the PDM build backend (according to PEP517), you can also use a file provider that contains your version, which is often referred to as a `dynamic` version.

The project version itself must comply to PEP440, which tells us, that it must consist of

* an optional epoch
* a mandatory major version part
* a mandatory minor version part
* a mandatory micro version part
* an optional pre-release part supporting alpha, beta or release-candidate part.

Tools like `bumpversion` or `bump2version` use their own configuration and might not conform to the PEP440 specification.

## Installation

You can install it using either pip (`pip install [--user] pdm-bump`) or using the PDM CLI (`pdm self add [--pip-args=--user] pdm-bump`).

## Usage

You can use it the following way:

```shell
$ grep version= pyproject.toml
version=0.1.0
$ pdm bump pre-release --pre alpha # creates 0.1.1a1
$ pdm bump pre-release --pre beta # creates 0.1.1.b1
$ pdm bump pre-release --pre release-candidate # creates 0.1.1rc1
$ pdm bump no-pre-release # creates 0.1.1
$ pdm bump micro # creates 0.1.2
$ pdm bump minor # creates 0.2.0
$ pdm bump major # creates 1.0.0
```

## VCS based actions

**NOTE**: Currently, only `git` is supported as VCS provider.

You can create tags based on your `pyproject.toml` version (or dynamic version) using the following command.

```shell
$ pdm bump tag # creates a git tag with a leading v
```
