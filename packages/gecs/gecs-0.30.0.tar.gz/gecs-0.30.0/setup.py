The `GEC` stands for **G**ood **E**nough **C**lassifier, which allows you to focus on other tasks such as feature engineering. If you deploy 100 of them, you get 100GECs.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe primary class in this package is `GEC`, which is derived from `LGBMClassifier`. Like its parent, GEC can be used to build and train gradient boosting models, but with the added feature of **automated bayesian hyperparameter optimization**. It can be imported from `gecs.gec` and then used in place of `LGBMClassifier`, with the same API.\n\nBy default, `GEC` optimizes `boosting_type`, `learning_rate`, `reg_alpha`, `reg_lambda`, `min_child_samples`, `min_child_weight`, `colsample_bytree`, `bagging_freq`, `bagging_fraction` and optionally `num_leaves` and `n_estimators`. Which hyperparameters to tune is fully customizable.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n    pip install gecs\n\n\n## Usage\n\n\nThe `GEC` class provides the same API to the user as the `LGBMClassifier` class of `lightgbm`, and additionally:\n\n-   the two additional parameters to the fit method:\n    - `n_iter`: Defines the number of hyperparameter combinations that the model should try. More iterations could lead to better model performance, but at the expense of computational resources\n\n    - `fixed_hyperparameters`: Allows the user to specify hyperparameters that the GEC should not optimize. By default, these are `n_estimators` and `num_leaves`. Any of the LGBMClassifier init arguments can be fixed, and so can  `bagging_freq` and `bagging_fraction`, but only jointly. This is done by passing the value `bagging`.\n\n-   the methods `serialize` and `deserialize`, which stores the `GEC` state for the hyperparameter optimization process, **but not the fitted** `LGBMClassifier` **parameters**, to a json file. To store the boosted tree model itself, you have to provide your own serialization or use `pickle`\n\n-   the methods `freeze` and `unfreeze` that turn the `GEC` functionally into a `LGBMClassifier` and back\n\n\n## Example\n\nThe default use of `GEC` would look like this:\n\n    from gecs.gec import GEC\n\n    gec.fit(X, y)\n\n    gec.serialize(path) # stores gec data and settings, but not underlying LGBMClassifier attributes\n\n    gec2 = GEC.deserialize(path, X, y) # X and y are necessary to fit the underlying LGBMClassifier\n\n    yhat = gec.predict(X)\n\n    gec.freeze() # freeze GEC so that it behaves like a LGBMClassifier\n\n    gec.unfreeze() # unfreeze to enable GEC hyperparameter optimisation\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute, please reach out and I'll design a process around it.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Contact Information\n\nYou can find my contact information on my website: [https://leonluithlen.eu](https://leonluithlen.eu)",
