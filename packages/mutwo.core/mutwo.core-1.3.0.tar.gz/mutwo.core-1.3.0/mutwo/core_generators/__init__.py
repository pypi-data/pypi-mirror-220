"""Classes and functions that generate data with the potential of artistic use.

The module is organised in different submodules where each submodule is named after the first known
person who introduced the respective algorithms. Unlike the :mod:`mutwo.converters` module the entered
data and the resulting data can be very different in type and form.

The term 'generators' simply labels the functionality of the module and shouldn't be confused with the Python
term for specific functions with the 'yield' keyword.
