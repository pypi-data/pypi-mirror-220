# ESTYP: Extended Statistical Toolkit Yet Practical

## Description

This library is a collection of statistical functions for Python. It includes a function for performing stepwise with AIC criterion and a function for the F-ratio test.

Actually, the name comes from the way my friends call me (esty), plus the "p" which is the initial of `python`.

## Changelog 

### V0.2.5

* Added `scipy>=1.11.1` as a depedency of the library.
* New modularization of the functions in the `testing` module.
* R like documentation in the `testing.var_test()` function.
* Added `testing.t_test()` function to perform t-test like in software R.

## Functions

* `linear_model.LogisticRegression()`: This class implements a logistic regression model. It inherits from the `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression()` class, but adds additional methods for calculating confidence intervals, p-values, and model summaries.
* `linear_model.stepwise.both_selection()`: This function performs both forward and backward variable selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). 
* `testing.var_test()`: Performs an F test to compare the variances of two samples from normal populations. This function is inspired by the `var.test()` function of the software R.
* `testing.t_test()`: Performs one and two sample t-tests on groups of data. This function is inspired by the `t.test()` function of the software R.
