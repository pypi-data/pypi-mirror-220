## Introduction

This project lets you draw the cloud system architecture in a declarative way with widely used `YAML` syntax which is de 
facto a standard for infrastructure and configurations so here habitual approaches are met and industry best practices
are aligned as well. It allows you to track an architecture's diagram changes with a version control system such as 
`Git`.

Currently, the following components are provided:

* Major cloud providers: AWS, Azume, GCP, IBM, Alibaba, Oracle, OpenStack, Digital Ocean and so on.
* On premise, Kubernetes, Firebase, Elastic, SaaS.
* Programming languages and frameworks.
* And other generic things such as C4.

Basically, with the project, you just define set of resources, compose them into groups and/or clusters and set a 
relationship, anything else is done under the hood.

## Disclaimer

`diagrams-yaml` is a wrapper around original [diagrams](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams). The original `diagrams` 
lets you draw the cloud system architecture in `Python` code. It was born for prototyping a new system architecture 
design without any design tools.

Under the hood, `diagrams-yaml` parse a `YAML` file and map to specific set of `diagrams`'s functions and classes, and
executes them in proper order.

## Getting Started

### How to install

As the project uses [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org) to render the diagram, you need to install it:

* For `Linux` — https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/#linux
* For `Windows` — https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/#windows
* For `macOS` — https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/#mac

After, you can install the project itself with the following command using `pip3`:

```bash
$ pip3 install diagrams-yaml
```

### Examples

Find examples of `YAML` files with configurations in the `examples` folder:

```bash
$ ls examples
├── ...
└── web-services-aws-architecture.yaml
```

## Usage

To draw an architecture, call `diagrams-yaml` command line interface, providing a path to a `YAML` file with 
configurations:

```bash
$ diagrams-yaml examples/web-services-aws.yaml
```

The drawing will be saved in the folder the command line interface was executed from:

```bash
$ ls
├── ...
└── web_services_aws.png
```
