## GigaGAN - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511v2">GigaGAN</a> <a href="https://mingukkang.github.io/GigaGAN/">(project page)</a>, new SOTA GAN out of Adobe.

I will also add a few findings from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/lightweight-gan">lightweight gan</a>, for faster convergence (skip layer excitation) and better stability (reconstruction auxiliary loss in discriminator).

It will also contain the code for the 1k - 4k upsamplers, which I find to be the highlight of this paper.

## Usage

Simple unconditional GAN, for starters

```python
import torch

from gigagan_pytorch import (
    GigaGAN,
    ImageDataset
)

gan = GigaGAN(
    generator = dict(
        dim_capacity = 16,
        style_network = dict(
            dim = 64,
            depth = 4
        ),
        image_size = 256,
        dim_max = 512,
        num_skip_layers_excite = 4,
        unconditional = True
    ),
    discriminator = dict(
        dim_capacity = 16,
        dim_max = 512,
        image_size = 256,
        num_skip_layers_excite = 4,
        unconditional = True
    )
).cuda()

# dataset

dataset = ImageDataset(
    folder = '/path/to/your/data',
    image_size = 256
)

dataloader = dataset.get_dataloader(batch_size = 1)

# training the discriminator and generator alternating
# for 100 steps in this example, batch size 1, gradient accumulated 8 times

gan(
    dataloader = dataloader,
    steps = 100,
    grad_accum_every = 8
)
```

For unconditional Unet Upsampler

```python
import torch
from gigagan_pytorch import GigaGAN, ImageDataset

gan = GigaGAN(
    train_upsampler = True,     # set this to True
    generator = dict(
        style_network = dict(
            dim = 64,
            depth = 4
        ),
        dim_capacity = 16,
        image_size = 256,
        input_image_size = 128,
        unconditional = True
    ),
    discriminator = dict(
        dim_capacity = 16,
        dim_max = 512,
        image_size = 256,
        num_skip_layers_excite = 4,
        unconditional = True
    )
).cuda()

dataset = ImageDataset(
    folder = '/path/to/your/data',
    image_size = 256
)

dataloader = dataset.get_dataloader(batch_size = 1)

# training the discriminator and generator alternating
# for 100 steps in this example, batch size 1, gradient accumulated 8 times

gan(
    dataloader = dataloader,
    steps = 100,
    grad_accum_every = 8
)
```

## Losses (wip)

* `G` - Generator
* `MSG` - Multiscale Generator
* `D` - Discriminator
* `MSD` - Multiscale Discriminator
* `GP` - Gradient Penalty
* `SSL` - Auxiliary Reconstruction in Discriminator (from Lightweight GAN)

A healthy run would have `G`, `MSG`, `D`, `MSD` with values hovering between `-10` to `10`, and usually staying pretty constant. If at any time after 1k training steps these values persist at triple digits, that would mean something is wrong.

`GP` and `SSL` should be pushed towards `0`. `GP` can occasionally spike; I like to imagine it as the networks undergoing some phase shift.

## Todo

- [x] make sure it can be trained unconditionally
- [x] read the relevant papers and knock out all 3 auxiliary losses
    - [x] matching aware loss
    - [x] clip loss
    - [x] vision-aided discriminator loss
    - [x] add reconstruction losses on arbitrary stages in the discriminator (lightweight gan)
    - [x] figure out how the random projections are used from projected-gan
    - [x] vision aided discriminator needs to extract N layers from the vision model in CLIP
    - [x] figure out whether to discard CLS token and reshape into image dimensions for convolution, or stick with attention and condition with adaptive layernorm - also turn off vision aided gan in unconditional case
- [x] unet upsampler
    - [x] add adaptive conv
    - [x] modify latter stage of unet to also output rgb residuals, and pass the rgb into discriminator. make discriminator agnostic to rgb being passed in
    - [x] do pixel shuffle upsamples for unet
- [x] get a code review for the multi-scale inputs and outputs, as the paper was a bit vague
- [x] add upsampling network architecture
- [x] make unconditional work for both base generator and upsampler
- [x] make text conditioned training work for both base and upsampler
- [x] make recon more efficient by random sampling patches

- [ ] add accelerate
- [ ] do a review of the auxiliary losses
- [ ] port over CLI from lightweight|stylegan2-pytorch
- [ ] hook up laion dataset for text-image
