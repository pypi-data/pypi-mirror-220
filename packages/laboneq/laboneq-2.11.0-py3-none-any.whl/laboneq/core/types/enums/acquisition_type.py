class AcquisitionType(Enum):
    """Acquisition type

    The following acquisition types supported:

        INTEGRATION:
            Returns acquired signal after demodulation and integration, using weighting vectors (kernel) up to 4096 points.

        SPECTROSCOPY_IQ:
            Returns acquired signal after demodulation and integration, using oscillator frequency (not limited to 4096 points).

        SPECTROSCOPY_PSD:
            Power Spectral density (PSD) mode. PSD is calculated on the hardware.

        SPECTROSCOPY:
            Same as `SPECTROSCOPY_IQ`.

        DISCRIMINATION:
            Returns the list of qubit states determined from demodulated and integrated signal after thresholding.

        RAW:
            Returns raw data after ADC up to 4096 samples. Only a single raw acquire event within an averaging loop per experiment is allowed.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.9

        Added `SPECTROSCOPY_IQ` (same as `SPECTROSCOPY`)

        Added `SPECTROSCOPY_PSD` for PSD Spectroscopy mode.
