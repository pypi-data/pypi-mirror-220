LatticeGeometryLib
==================

Description
===========

LatticeGeometryLib is a python library for creating spacial lattice structures which
consist of an interconnected network of nodes struts and plates. These individual entities
are combined into a unitary cell which periodic repetition creates the lattice. Furthermore
this lattice can be inserted into any shell-like CAD geometry. This library is based on the CADQuery library.
