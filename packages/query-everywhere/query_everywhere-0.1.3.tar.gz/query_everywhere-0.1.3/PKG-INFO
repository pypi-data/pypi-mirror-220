# Query Everywhere

query your data in every RDBMS.

## Notices

* You should install your db driver(like `psycopg2-binary`) before use.

## Example

```python
from query_everywhere import Queryer

# Create a Queryer with DSN
dsn = "sqlite:///db.sqlite3"
queryer = Queryer(dsn)


# Query
filters = [
    ("name__contains", "part of name"),
    ("age__gte", 20),
    ("age__lt", 30),
    ("address__neq", "beijing"),
    ("address__eq", "shanghai"),
    ("address__icontains", "beijing"),
]
order = "create_time desc"
limit = 10
offset = 0
data = queryer.query("people", filters, order, limit, offset)
print(data)

# It where do 
# SELECT * FROM "people" WHERE name LIKE ? AND age >= ? AND age < ?
# AND address != ? AND address = ? AND LOWER(address) LIKE ? ORDER BY ? LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
```
