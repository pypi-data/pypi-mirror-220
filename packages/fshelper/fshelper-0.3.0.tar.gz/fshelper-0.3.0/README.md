### Credentials for the FreshService API
The `fshelper.Credential` class is meant to help gather the basic authentication information for the FreshService API.
Provide your FreshService API key as the username and `X` as the password to the constructor.

### RequestService
Wrapper for the `requests` package to create an authenticated requests `Session`.   
Takes a `Credential` object and the company's FreshService domain (the part prior to `freshservice.com`).
Use this as a context manager or call the `RequestService.new_session()` method in a try, except, finally block with
`RequestService.session.close()` in the finally block.


### Endpoints
Different classes to work with different FreshService API endpoints.
