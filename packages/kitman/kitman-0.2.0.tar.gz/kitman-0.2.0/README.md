# Kitman

A toolkit for solving generic issues when building modern SaaS applications in Python.

Kitman is named after the role it plays in sports, where the kitman maintains and brings the gear, so the athlethes can focus on performing. <br>
Developers are the athlethes and this project's aim is to bring all the tools that you need to create modern SaaS applications. <br>
It solves this issue primarily through creating interoperability between libraries and frameworks that developers already love - but continously struggle or repeat themselves when they incorporate them into products. <br>
It builds on top of the interoperability to create building blocks and services that are _easy to_:<br>

- Integrate
- Extend
- Combine
