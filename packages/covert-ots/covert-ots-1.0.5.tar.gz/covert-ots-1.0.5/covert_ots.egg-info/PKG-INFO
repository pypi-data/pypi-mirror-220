# covert
A secure way to communicate your secrets
- Find the CLI (wip) [here](https://pypi.org/project/covert-ots/)
- Find the website [here](https://covert-ots.web.app/)
- Backend Deployed on Google Cloud App Engine
## Working
- When a user saves a secret it is encrypted on the client side using a pass phrase encryption algo.
- A unique key (url in case of web clients) is generated for every stored secret.
- A user can then share this key (or url) to someone else, who can then retrieve the secret using the correct pass phrase
- The encrypted token is then fetched and decrypted using the pass phrase on the client and displayed to the user (only once)
