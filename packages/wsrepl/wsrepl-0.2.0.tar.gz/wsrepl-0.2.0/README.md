# `wsrepl` - Websocket REPL for pentesters

`wsrepl` is an interactive websocket REPL designed specifically for penetration testing. It provides an interface for observing incoming websocket messages and sending new ones, with an easy-to-use framework for automating this communication.

## Features

- Interactively send and receive websocket messages
- Customize headers, ping/pong messages, and other parameters
- Handle SSL verification and reconnections
- Plug-in support for automating complex interaction scenarios
- Full logging and message history
- Supports curl command line arguments for easy onboarding from Developer Tools or Burp Suite (use 'Copy as Curl' menu and replace `curl` with `wsrepl`)

## Installation

You can download and install wsrepl using pip:

```
pip install wsrepl
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install it from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/doyensec/wsrepl
cd wsrepl
pip install .
```

## Usage

The basic command for starting wsrepl is as follows:

```
wsrepl -u URL
```

Replace URL with your target websocket URL, e.g. `wss://echo.websocket.org`. For more options and settings, you can use the -h or --help option:

```

## Automating with Plugins

To automate your websocket communication, you can create a Python plugin by extending the [Plugin](wsrepl/Plugin.py) class in wsrepl. This class allows you to define various hooks that are triggered during different stages of the websocket communication.

Here is an outline of how to define a plugin:

```python
class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    # Messages that will be sent to the server on (re-)connect.
    messages = ["message1", "message2", "message3"]

    def init(self):
        # This method is called when the plugin is loaded.
        # Use it to set initial settings or generate self.messages dynamically.
        pass

    async def on_connect(self):
        # This method is called when the websocket connection is established.
        pass

    async def on_message_received(self, message: WSMessage):
        # This method is called when a message is received from the server.
        pass

    # ... Other hooks can be defined here.
```

Refer to the source of [Plugin class](wsrepl/Plugin.py) for the full list of hooks you can use and what they do:

### Example Plugin

Here is an example of a plugin that sends a predefined authentication message to a server:

```python
from wsrepl import Plugin
import json

class AuthPlugin(Plugin):
    def init(self):
        auth_message = {
            "messageType": "auth",
            "auth": {
                "user": "user-1234"",
                "password": "password-1234"
            }
        }
        self.messages = [json.dumps(auth_message)]
```

This plugin can be used by specifying it when running wsrepl:

```
wsrepl -u URL -P auth_plugin.py
```

Replace URL with your target websocket URL and auth_plugin.py with the path to the Python file containing your plugin.

[docs/](./docs/) directory contains a few more example plugins.
