# missForest
This project is a Python implementation of the MissForest algorithm, a powerful tool designed to handle missing values in tabular datasets. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a more accurate method of imputing missing data.

The project consists of a single function, fit_transform, which is responsible for imputing all missing values in a given dataset. While MissForest may take more time to process datasets compared to simpler imputation methods, it typically yields more accurate results.

Please note that the efficiency of MissForest is a trade-off for its accuracy. It is designed for those who prioritize data accuracy over processing speed. This makes it an excellent choice for projects where the quality of data is paramount.

# Example
To install MissForest using pip.

    pip install MissForest

Imputing a dataset:

    from missforest.missforest import MissForest
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        df = pd.read_csv("insurance.csv")
        mf = MissForest()
        df_imputed = mf.fit_transform(df)
