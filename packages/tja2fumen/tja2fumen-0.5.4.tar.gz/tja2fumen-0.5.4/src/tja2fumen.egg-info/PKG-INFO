# tja2fumen

`tja2fumen` is a tool for Taiko no Tatsujin that allows you to convert TJA charts (`.tja`) to fumen charts (`.bin`).

### Goals

- Provide open source code to act as a reference for parsing and writing both the TJA and Fumen file formats.
- Fix the existing issues with `tja2bin.exe`:
  - Desync due to `#BPMCHANGE` commands. (https://github.com/Fluto/TakoTako/issues/16)
  - Crashes due to `#SECTION`, `#NEXTSONG`, `#LYRIC`, etc. commands.

# Usage

tja2fumen is included as part of several existing projects. So, you may be using tja2fumen already!

- **XB1/TDMX**: [TakoTako](https://github.com/fluto/takotako) converts both chart and audio files for XB1/TDMX.
- **Nijiro**: [TaikoSoundEditor](https://github.com/NotImplementedLife/TaikoSoundEditor) converts both chart and audio files for NIjiro.

## → Adding `tja2fumen.exe` to older TakoTako versions (3.2.0 and below)

> **Note**: Before adding `tja2fumen` to TakoTako, you may want to back up the original `tja2bin.exe` file, to make sure you can switch back to the old converter if necessary. The easiest way to do this is by renaming the existing file to `tja2bin.exe.bak`.

To use this converter with TakoTako, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/vivaria/tja2fumen/releases) page and download the `tja2fumen.exe` file attached to the release. Then, rename `tja2fumen.exe` to `tja2bin.exe`, and place the file in the TakoTako plugin folder.

TakoTako's plugin folder is inside of the BepInEx folder, which will typically look something like:

```
C:\XboxGames\T Tablet\Content\BepInEx\plugins\com.fluto.takotako
```

## → Using `tja2fumen` directly

If you'd like to build a project on top of `tja2fumen`, you have several options:

### 1. Using the executable file (`tja2fumen.exe`)

Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/vivaria/tja2fumen/releases) page, and download the `tja2fumen.exe` file attached to the release.

Then, you can convert a TJA file on the command line by running:

```
tja2fumen.exe file.tja
```

### 2. Using the `tja2fumen` Python package

If you're familiar with Python, you can install `tja2fumen` by running:

```
pip install tja2fumen
```

Then, you can convert a TJA file on the command line by running:

```
tja2fumen file.tja
```

Or, you can import the `main` function in your Python code, and convert TJA files this way instead:

```python
from tja2fumen import main
main(argv=["file.tja"])
```

# Reporting bugs

If you've found a .TJA file that `tja2fumen` converts incorrectly, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/vivaria/tja2fumen/issues/new) on the tja2fumen repo. 

It is especially important that you attach the song files to the issue. You can do this by adding the song files to a `.zip` (Select files -> Right click -> "Send to" -> "Compressed (zipped) folder"), and then uploading the `.zip` to the issue. This greatly helps me to reproduce and fix any issues.
