# Task (cade-task)
Task is a light CLI wrapper around Reminders.app ([reminders-cli](https://github.com/keith/reminders-cli)) that unifies use with dead-simple, sane defaults to remove friction from GTD.

## Install

Installation is easiest via [brew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install cadeef/homebrew-tap/cade-task
```

## Usage

Commands are aware of project context where available. Task assumes you store all of your projects in the same directory (defined with `—-project-dir`), shell aliases are your friend.

Short flags exist for all options, but the long version is used here for clarity.

### List Tasks

List tasks for your current project:

```
task list
```

Not in your project directory? No problem, specify the list you’d like to interact with:

```
task list —-list <yourgloriouslist>
```

Don’t feel like passing a list? Specify `—-list` without an argument to select at the prompt.

The list selection convention is consistent throughout the app.

### Add a Task

```
task add A glorious task that should be completed
```

Don’t worry about quotes unless you’re doing something funky, task will glue the arguments together for you.

### Complete Tasks

Complete one or more tasks:

```
task complete 6 1 3
```

Tasks are completed in reverse numerical order (10...1) to avoid re-parsing the task list after each task is completed.


### Open Reminders.app

Conveniently open (or bring to the foreground) Reminders.app:

```
task open
```

Additional usage information is available via `—-help` on the command line.

### Shell Aliases

I’m not keen on managing additional configuration files for simple applications so there is no external config to set, but the defaults may not work for you. Shell aliases let us accomplish similar without another file to manage. Define a different project directory from bash:

```bash
TASK_PROJECT_DIR=“${HOME}/myprettyneatprojectdir”
# List tasks in current project
alias t=“task -d ${TASK_PROJECT_DIR} list”
# Add task in current project
alias ta=“task -d ${TASK_PROJECT_DIR} add”
# Complete task(s) in current project
alias tc=“task -d ${TASK_PROJECT_DIR} complete”
# Sync TODO|FIXME in current project
alias tsync=“task -d ${TASK_PROJECT_DIR} sync”
# List task lists
alias tl=“task lists”
# Open Reminders.app
alias to=“task open”
```

Tweak until your heart is content without monkeying yet another config file.

## Caveats

* Apple doesn’t expose the ability to create lists via the EventKit API or AppleScript. 😔 In scenarios where a project task list doesn’t exist, you’ll be prompted to create the list in Reminders.app.
* Task wraps [Keith Smiley’s reminders-cli](https://github.com/keith/reminders-cli). Task is intended as a backend-agnostic wrapper that standardizes use without being tied to a specific implementation— I don’t want to retrain muscle memory if a new killer app comes along.
