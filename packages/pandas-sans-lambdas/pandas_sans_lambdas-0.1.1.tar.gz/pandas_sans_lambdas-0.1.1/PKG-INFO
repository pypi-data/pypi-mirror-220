# Pandas Sans Lambdas

![Tests](https://github.com/jakeantmann/pandas_sans_lambdas/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

Pandas method chaining using `assign` or `loc` usually means using lambdas. These get repetitive and reduce readability. Pandas Sans Lambdas is a solution to this. Here's an example:

``` python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_sans_lambdas import col

df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1,2,3], "b": [4,5,6]})

# The old way
df = df.assign(with_lambdas = lambda DF: DF["a"] ** 2 / DF["b"])

# The new way
df = df.assign(sans_lambdas = col("a") ** 2 / col("b"))

print(df)
```

Hopefully you agree that this is more readable!

## Current project status
