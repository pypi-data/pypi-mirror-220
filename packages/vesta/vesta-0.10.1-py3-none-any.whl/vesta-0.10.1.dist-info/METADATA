# Vesta

Vesta is a [Vestaboard](https://www.vestaboard.com/) client library for Python.
It provides API clients and character encoding utilities.

## Installation

Vesta requires Python 3.8 or later. It can be installed [via PyPI][pypi]:

```sh
$ python -m pip install vesta
```

Its only runtime dependency is the [HTTPX library][httpx], which will be
installed automatically.

[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/vesta/
[httpx]: https://www.python-httpx.org/

## Usage

### API Clients

#### `Client`

The `Client` type is initialized with an API key and secret:

```pycon
>>> import vesta
>>> client = vesta.Client(API_KEY, API_SECRET)
```

Then, you can make API calls using one of the provided methods:

```pycon
>>> client.get_viewer()
{'_id': ..., '_created': '1629081092624', 'type': 'installation', 'installation': {'_id': ...}}

>>> client.get_subscriptions()
[{'_id': ..., '_created': '1629081092624', 'title': None, 'icon': None, 'installation': {'_id': ..., 'installable': {'_id': ...}}, 'boards': [{'_id': ...}]}]

>>> client.post_message(SUBSCRIPTION_ID, "Hello, World")
{'message': {'id': ..., 'text': 'Hello, World', 'created': '1635801572442'}}
```

Messages can be posted as either text strings or two-dimensional arrays of
character codes representing the exact positions of characters on the board.

If text is specified, the lines will be centered horizontally and vertically.
Character codes will be inferred for alphanumeric and punctuation characters,
or they can be explicitly specified using curly braces containing the character
code (such as `{5}` or `{65}`).

#### `LocalClient`

`LocalClient` provides a client interface for interacting with a Vestaboard
over the local network using [Vestaboard's Local API](https://docs.vestaboard.com/local).

Note that Vestaboard owners must first request a
[Local API enablement token](https://www.vestaboard.com/local-api)
in order to use the Local API.

```py
import vesta
local_client = vesta.LocalClient()

# The Vestaboard's Local API must be enabled to get its Local API key. After
# you've done this once, you can save the key somewhere safe and pass it
# directly to LocalClient() for future client initializations.
local_api_key = local_client.enable(ENABLEMENT_TOKEN)
# e.g. local_client = LocalClient(local_api_key)
assert local_client.enabled

# Once enabled, you can write and read messages:
message = vesta.encode_text("{67} Hello, World {68}")
assert local_client.write_message(message)
assert local_client.read_message() == message
```

#### `ReadWriteClient`

`ReadWriteClient` provides a client interface for interacting with a Vestaboard
using the [Read / Write API](https://docs.vestaboard.com/read-write).

Note that Vestaboard owners must first obtain their Read / Write API key by
enabling the Vestaboard's Read / Write API via the Settings section of the
mobile app or from the Developer section of the web app.

```py
import vesta
rw_client = vesta.ReadWriteClient("read_write_key")

# Once enabled, you can write and read messages:
message = vesta.encode_text("{67} Hello, World {68}")
assert rw_client.write_message(message)
assert rw_client.read_message() == message
```

### Character Encoding

All Vestaboard characters (letters, numbers, symbols, and colors) are encoded
as integer [character codes](https://docs.vestaboard.com/characters). Vesta
includes some useful routines for working with these character codes.

`encode()` encodes a string as a list of character codes. In addition to
printable characters, the string can contain character code sequences inside
curly braces, such as `{5}` or `{65}`.

```pycon
>>> vesta.encode("{67} Hello, World {68}")
[67, 0, 8, 5, 12, 12, 15, 55, 0, 23, 15, 18, 12, 4, 0, 68]
```

`encode_row()` encodes a string as a row of character codes. It builds on
`encode()` by providing alignment control.

```pycon
>>> vesta.encode_row("{67} Hello, World {68}", align="center")
[0, 0, 0, 67, 0, 8, 5, 12, 12, 15, 55, 0, 23, 15, 18, 12, 4, 0, 68, 0, 0, 0]
```

`encode_text()` encodes a string of text into rows of character codes, further
building on `encode()` and `encode_row()` with the addition of alignment,
margin control, and line breaks.

```pycon
>>> encode_text("multiple\nlines\nof\ntext", align="center", valign="middle")
[
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 21, 12, 20, 9, 16, 12, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 9, 14, 5, 19, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 15, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20, 5, 24, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]
```

Lastly, `pprint()` can be used to pretty-print encoded characters to the
console, which can be useful during development.

```pycon
>>> vesta.pprint([0, 0, 0, 67, 0, 8, 5, 12, 12, 15, 55, 0, 23, 15, 18, 12, 4, 0, 68, 0, 0, 0])
| | | |◼︎| |H|E|L|L|O|,| |W|O|R|L|D| |◼︎| | | |
```

# Changelog

## 0.10.1 - 2023-07-22
### Added
- Added text message support to `ReadWriteClient.write_message()`.

### Fixed
- `ReadWriteClient.get_message()` now correctly returns a `Rows` value rather
  than a JSON-encoded string.

## 0.10.0 - 2023-06-06
### Added
- Added `max_rows` to `encode_text()` for controlling the maximum number of rows
  that will be returned (defaulting to 6). It can be set to a lower value to
  produce a partial board or 0 to support unlimited rows.

### Changed
- `encode_text()` no longer raises `ValueError` when the result exceeds the
  maximum number of rows. Instead, the result is truncated to `max_rows`.

## 0.9.0 - 2022-12-11
### Added
- Added `Color.BLANK` and `Color.FILLED` color values.

### Changed
- Switched to [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) as the underlying HTTP library.
- `Color.BLACK` now uses the official "black" character code (70). Use `Color.BLANK`
  for character code 0 (previously used by `Color.BLACK`).
- The default "fill" color is now `Color.BLANK` instead of `Color.BLACK`.

### Removed
- Dropped support for Python 3.7.

## 0.8.0 - 2022-08-13
### Added
- `LocalClient` provides a client interface to Vestaboard's Local API.
- `ReadWriteClient` provides a client interface to Vestaboard's Read / Write API.

### Changed
- The documentation now uses the [Furo theme](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo).
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) version 2.27.0 or later is now required.

## 0.7.3 - 2022-05-31
### Added
- Various typing improvements, including a `py.typed` marker file.

## 0.7.2 - 2021-12-30
### Added
- `encode_text()`'s `valign` argument can be set to `None` to disable row
  padding.

### Changed
- `encode()`'s error handling has been improved. A `ValueError` will now
  be raised for all unsupported character codes, including those within the
  [0, 69] range such as 57, 58, and 61.

## 0.7.1 - 2021-12-19
### Fixed
- `encode_text()` was adding a leading blank character to the row after a line
  break.

## 0.7.0 - 2021-12-19
### Added
- `encode_text()` offers a `valign` argument for controlling vertical alignment
  within the board.
- `Client.post_message()` now raises ValueError if `message` is a list of
  encoded characters with the wrong dimensions. 

### Changed
- `encode_text()` now always produces six rows of output (a full board).

### Removed
- Dropped support for Python 3.6, which has officially reached the end of its
  supported life.

## 0.6.0 - 2021-12-05
### Added
- `encode_text()` for encoding lines of text

### Fixed
- Fix space character encoding

## 0.5.1 - 2021-11-06
### Added
- Initial Sphinx-based documentation

## 0.5.0 - 2021-11-01
- Initial release
