### 1. Descprition of the repository
        This repository is to build a base autoamtion framework. 
        We would like to integrate the common helpers and libraries here and then build a lib.
        Later the only thing is to add the cases according to the features. 
        Since most of the common helpers and libraries have been integrated to the lib, 
        you only need to import that lib and methods.

### 2. How to use?
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   

### 3. Things need to follow:  
- [x] Create a python repository
- [x] Create a file named [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and only input to this file [liveramp-automation-framework](liveramp-automation-framework), you can ignore the version
- [x] Copy [conftest.py](conftest.py) and [pytest.ini](pytest.ini) to your repository's root directory
- [x]

### 1. Install the following two tools

    and in this progress, there would pop up an input row to ask for your Username and Password
