## Unit-testing for mails

### Setup

This package provides a solid and proven way of unit-testing your emails. If you want to build your emails in a robust
way in the first place, read up how in the section "Mailing".

Side note: This part was also published as a
[blog article](https://medium.com/ambient-innovation/thorough-and-reliable-unit-testing-of-emails-in-django-5f34901b1b16)
at Medium.

At first, initialise the class in your testing class. Because the class itself behaves more or less like a singleton you
can do this in the `setupTestData()`. It will be executed only once per test class and — compared to `setUp()` — not for
every test.

````python
from ai_django_core.mail.services.tests import EmailTestService
from django.test import TestCase

class MyTestClass(TestCase):

    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        cls.email_test_service = EmailTestService()
````

Now you can use the service in all of your tests. If you know that you want to test emails in several classes, it makes
sense to create a base test class which the other classes inherit from.

### Querying for emails

To provide a djangoesque look-and-feel, our test service can query the mail outbox for certain criteria.

The easiest thing to do is get all emails:

    list_of_emails = self.email_test_service.all()

Maybe you want a specific one? You can filter for a given subject by using
a string or a regular expression. Additionally, you can filter for a recipient,
the to, cc and bcc attributes:

````python
import re

# Get all mails with given subject
my_email = self.email_test_service.filter(subject='Nigerian prince')

# Get all mails with given subject using a regular expression
my_email = self.email_test_service.filter(subject=re.compile('Ni(.*) prince'))

# Get all mails with given to-recipient
my_email = self.email_test_service.filter(to='foo@bar.com')
````

Of course, you can connect filters as well:

````python
my_email = self.email_test_service.filter(
    subject='Nigerian prince',
    to='spambot@bar.com',
    cc='copy@bar.com',
    bcc='blind.copy@bar.com'
)
````

Once you have a queryset of emails — meaning the result of one of the queries above — you can work with it.

You can count the results, especially good for assertions:

````python
# Count the number of results
quantity = self.email_test_service.all().count()
````

Do you need the first or last element in the list?

````python
# Get first item in list
first_mail = self.email_test_service.filter(subject='Nigerian prince').first()

# Get last item in list
last_mail = self.email_test_service.filter(subject='Nigerian prince').last()
````

It is very common that you expect one specific email, and you want to know if your mail queryset contains exactly this
element. So there is a helper function for this, too:

````python
# Returns `True` if the queryset contains exactly one item
self.email_test_service.filter(subject='Nigerian prince').one()
````

If you want to access a specific index, you can access it like a queryset:

````python
# Fetch the second email
self.email_test_service.filter(subject='Nigerian prince')[1]

# Fetch the next-to-last email
self.email_test_service.filter(subject='Nigerian prince')[-2]
````

### Assertion helpers

Usually, there are only a couple of ways you can blackbox-test emails. You want to ensure the subject, recipient or
content functions the way you expect it to be.

That’s why the class provides some shortcuts which wrap the assertion.

1. You want to check for exactly one result?

````python
self.email_test_service.filter(to='foo@bar.com').assert_one()
````

2. Do you want to check the quantity of found emails?

````python
expected_number_of_emails = 1
self.email_test_service.filter(to='foo@bar.com').assert_quantity(expected_number_of_emails)
````

3. Do you want to check the subject?

````python
self.email_test_service.filter(to='foo@bar.com')[0].assert_subject('Reset password')
````

Finally, we have a look at the content of the email. As you probably know, an email object consists of two parts. A
plain-text and an HTML part. To avoid checking two times, the wrapper assert_body_contains() checks in both parts and
fails if the given string is missing in one of them.

4. You want to check if a certain string is included in the body?

````python
self.email_test_service.filter(to='foo@bar.com')[0].assert_body_contains('inheritance')
````

5. Sometimes you want to check if something is NOT part of the body…

````python
self.email_test_service.filter(to='foo@bar.com')[0].assert_body_contains_not('scam')
````

To make your life a little easier and happier, each of these methods takes an optional parameter msg which is passed to
the assertion and will be shown if it goes sideways. Here is an example:

````python
self.email_test_service.filter(to='foo@bar.com')[0].assert_body_contains('inheritance', msg='Missing words!')
````

## Mixins

### ClassBasedViewTestMixin

This test case mixin helps out when unit-testing a view. It provides methods for the three main ways to request a
view: `get`, `post` and `delete`. Authentication and the creation of the request is handled internally.

````python
class MyViewTestCase(ClassBasedViewTestMixin, TestCase):
    view_class = views.MyView

    def test_get_call_authenticated(self):
        response = self.get(user=self.user, url_params={'pk': 17})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)

    def test_get_call_not_authenticated(self):
        response = self.get(user=None, url_params={'pk': 17})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 403)

    def test_post_call(self):
        response = self.post(user=self.user, data={'foo': 'bar'}, url_params={'pk': 17})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)

    def test_delete_call(self):
        response = self.delete(user=self.user, url_params={'pk': 17})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 202)
````

### RequestProviderMixin

In many cases you will find yourself in the position that you need a request in your unittests. A wise programmer will
of course try to avoid looping the request object through all services - but from time to time you just end up with a
well written method which takes the request as a parameter.

For these cases the toolbox provides a handy mixin, from which you can easily derive your test class. Then you will be
able to use a method called `get_request(user=None)`. If you specify a user, he/she will be the request user. In most
cases you won't need to set an explicit url, so `/` will be taken as a default. If you do need it, just pass set
the `url` parameter.

````python
from django.test import TestCase
from ai_django_core.tests.mixins import RequestProviderMixin


class MyAwesomeTest(RequestProviderMixin, TestCase):

    def test_something_with_a_request_without_a_user(self):
        request = self.get_request(None)
        ...

    def test_something_with_a_request_having_a_user(self):
        ...
        request = self.get_request(user=my_user)
        ...

    def test_something_with_a_request_with_set_url(self):
        ...
        request = self.get_request(url='/path/to/something')
        ...

````

### BaseViewPermissionTestMixin

Please refer to the view layer section to get details about how to use this view test mixin.

### DjangoMessagingFrameworkTestMixin

If you're working with Django views, you might want to use (and therefore test) the Django messaging framework. To make
this as easy as possible, just inherit your view test class from the `DjangoMessagingFrameworkTestMixin`.

You can either check for a full message or just for a partial one.

````python
from django.test import TestCase
from ai_django_core.tests.mixins import DjangoMessagingFrameworkTestMixin

class MyViewTest(DjangoMessagingFrameworkTestMixin, TestCase):

    def test_my_message_full_case(self):
        # The view creates a message: "It's sunny on Sundays."
        view = function_to_instantiate_your_view()
        self.assert_full_message_in_request(
            view.request, "It's sunny on Sundays.")

    def test_my_message_partial_case(self):
        # The view creates a message: "I have added *n* new records" with "n" being a variable
        view = function_to_instantiate_your_view()
        self.assert_partial_message_in_request(
            view.request, 'I have added')
````

## Test structure validator

### Motivation

When working in a Django project, it can happen very easily that you create unit-tests in a way that they won't be
auto-discovered. The mean thing about this is that you can still run those tests - so it's hard to find those issues.

The most common mistakes are forgetting the `__init__.py` in the directory or not prefixing your python files
with `test_`. To tackle this problem, we created a handy management command you can run manually or integrate in your
CI pipeline.

    python manage.py validate_test_structure


### Configuration

You can define all of those settings variables in your main Django settings file.

| Variable                                        | Type | Default                 | Explanation                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TEST_STRUCTURE_VALIDATOR_FILE_WHITELIST         | list | []                      | Filenames which will be ignored, will always ignore `__init__`      |
| TEST_STRUCTURE_VALIDATOR_BASE_DIR               | Path | settings.BASE_DIR       | Root path to your application (BASE_DIR in a vanilla Django setup)   |
| TEST_STRUCTURE_VALIDATOR_BASE_APP_NAME          | str  | "apps"                  | Directory where all your Django apps live in, can be set to "".     |
| TEST_STRUCTURE_VALIDATOR_APP_LIST               | list | settings.INSTALLED_APPS | List of all your Django apps you want to validate                   |
| TEST_STRUCTURE_VALIDATOR_IGNORED_DIRECTORY_LIST | list | []                      | Directories which will be ignored, will always ignore `__pycache__` |
