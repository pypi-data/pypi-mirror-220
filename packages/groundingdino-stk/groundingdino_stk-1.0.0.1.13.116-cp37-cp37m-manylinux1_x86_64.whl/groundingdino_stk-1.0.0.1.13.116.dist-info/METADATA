                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# GroundingDINO-stk

Welcome to the GroundingDINO-stk project!   This repository provides a source that can install the `GroundingDINO` library from `PyPI`. The `GroundingDINO` version was last updated on `2023/06/29`.

This document contains all the information you need to get started, including:

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - The basic requirements to use this project.
* [Support List](#support-list) - The versions of different libraries and tools that are compatible with this project.
* [Installation](#installation) - Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up this project.

## Prerequisites

The project requires `CUDA` version 10.2 or later. `CUDA` is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia. It allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose processing.

## Support List

### Supported Versions 

The following table lists the versions of `torch`, `torchvision`, and `Python` that are compatible with this project, along with the respective versions of `CUDA` they support. Ensure your setup aligns with one of these combinations for smooth operation of the project.

### We support the following versions.

* Currently, `PyTorch` only supported the latest version of `Cuda` is 11.8.

| `torch`            | `torchvision`      | `Python`                  | `CUDA` | `11.8` | `11.7` | `11.6` | `11.3` | `10.2` |

| `1.2`              | `0.4.1`            | `==2.7`, `>=3.5`, `<=3.7` |
| `1.1`              | `0.3`              | `==2.7`, `>=3.5`, `<=3.7` |
| `<=1.0`            | `0.2`              | `==2.7`, `>=3.5`, `<=3.7` |

## Installation 

Installation of this project requires careful matching of `torch` and `CUDA` versions. The versions you choose should align with the supported versions mentioned above.

### Match list 

The following table provides a match list of `torch` and `CUDA` versions that are known to work together well:

| `torch` | `CUDA` |
| :-----: | :----: |
|  `2.0`  | `11.8` |
|  `2.0`  | `11.7` |
| `1.13`  | `11.7` |
| `1.13`  | `11.6` |
| `1.12`  | `11.6` |
| `1.12`  | `11.3` |
| `1.12`  | `11.2` |
| `1.11`  | `11.3` |
| `1.11`  | `10.2` |
| `1.10`  | `10.2` |

#### Method 1 

This method involves using pip3 to install the package directly. Replace `<torch-version>` and `<cuda-version>` with the versions you wish to install. The `cuda-version` does not include a `dot`.

```bash
# <groundingdino-stk-version> = 1.0.0
# <torch-version> = 2.0
# <cuda-version> = 117
# Example:
pip3 install groundingdino-stk==<groundingdino-stk-version>.<torch-version>.<cuda-version> --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu<cuda-version>
```

#### Method 2 

This method involves modifying and running the `install.sh` file. Replace the placeholder versions on lines 11 ~ 13 of the `install.sh` file with the versions of `groundingdino-stk`, `torch` and `CUDA` that you want to install. Then, run the `install.sh` file.

```bash
bash install.sh
```
