# liveramp-automation
an automation framework helps you qucikly author scripts for any automation testing 



### Background 

    Do you want to create your own test project, 
    but struggle with configuring the environment, 
    feel lost in choosing a testing framework, 
    confused about integration and execution, 
    and helpless in displaying test reports or recording test results in the long run?

    Don't worry.

    We provide an open-source and easy-to-use testing framework 
    that helps QE/DEV and anyone interested in quickly getting started 
    with various types of automation testing.


### 1. Descprition of the repository
        This repository is to build a base autoamtion framework. 
        We would like to integrate the common helpers and libraries here and then build a lib.
        Later the only thing is to add the cases according to the features. 
        Since most of the common helpers and libraries have been integrated to the lib, 
        you only need to import that lib and methods.

### 2. Things need to follow:  
- [x] Create a python repository
- [x] Create a file named [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and only input to this file [liveramp-automation](liveramp-automation), you can ignore the version
- [x] Copy [conftest.py](conftest.py) and [pytest.ini](pytest.ini) to your repository's root directory
- [x] Author scripts
- [x] Done
