# Known Issues:
- Linux X Server will raise an error if some fonts are missing, especially emoji fonts - See Dependencies below

- Mac - Tkinter - Can have issues depending on versions. See here: https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk

- Systray Icon: Depends on GTK 3+ and AppIndicator3 on Linux. Install these packages if you need systray to run properly.

# Dependencies:
- Python 3.8+: Tested with Python 3.11+ on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit.
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/): for merging audio with DASH videos.
- Fonts: (Linux X Server will raise an error if some fonts are missing, especially emoji fonts. Below are the 
recommended fonts to be installed.

    ```
    ttf-linux-libertine 
    ttf-inconsolata 
    ttf-emojione
    ttf-symbola
    noto-fonts
    ```
- [PycURL](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.html): a Python interface to libcurl, the multiprotocol file transfer library. Used as the download engine.
- [youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl): Famous YouTube downloader, limited use for meta information extraction only but videos are downloaded using PycURL.
- [yt_dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp): yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork based on the now inactive youtube-dlc.
- [Certifi](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi): required by PycURL for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates.
- [Plyer](https://github.com/kivy/plyer): for systray area notification.
- [AwesomeTkinter](https://github.com/Aboghazala/AwesomeTkinter): for application GUI.
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org): the friendly PIL fork. PIL is an acronym for Python Imaging Library.
- [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray): for systray icon.

**Note for PycURL:**
For Windows users who wants to run from source or use pip:
Unfortunately, PycURL removed binary versions for Windows and it now has to be built from source. See here: http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/install.html#windows
`python -m pip install pycurl` will fail on Windows, your best choice is to use the portable version.
