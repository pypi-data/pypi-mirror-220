Features
Extended Functionality: Web3R expands on the capabilities of Web3.py, offering additional methods and utilities for interacting with Ethereum networks.
Etherscan Integration: Seamlessly integrate with Etherscan's API to retrieve blockchain data, such as transaction details, account balances, contract information, and more.
Simplified Workflow: Web3R simplifies the process of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, reducing the amount of code required for common operations.
Enhanced Data Visualization: The wrapper includes functionality to generate graphical representations of Ethereum networks, allowing for visual analysis and exploration of blockchain data.
Installation
To install Web3R, follow these steps:

Clone the Web3R repository from GitHub:
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web3r.git
Navigate to the project directory:
shell
Copy code
cd web3r
Install the required dependencies using pip:
shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
You're all set! You can now import and use the Web3R package in your Python projects.
Getting Started
To start using Web3R, follow these steps:

Import the Web3R module into your Python script:
python
Copy code
from web3r import Web3R
Initialize an instance of Web3R by providing your Ethereum network's endpoint and your Etherscan API key:
python
Copy code
web3r = Web3R(endpoint='https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-infura-api-key', etherscan_api_key='your-etherscan-api-key')
Begin interacting with the Ethereum network and Etherscan's API using the various methods and utilities provided by Web3R. For example, to get the balance of an Ethereum account:
python
Copy code
balance = web3r.get_balance(address='0x...')
print(f"The balance of the account is: {balance}")
