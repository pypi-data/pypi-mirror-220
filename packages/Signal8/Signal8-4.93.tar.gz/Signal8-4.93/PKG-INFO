# A Fork of Multi-Agent Particle Environment

Signal8 is an enhanced version of the Simple environment, originally developed by the [Farama Foundation](https://farama.org/) as part of their [Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/mpe/).

# Signal8

Signal8 is an open-source research project devoted to facilitating the evolution of communication strategies in multi-agent systems. The project, drawing inspiration from real-world scenarios such as disaster response and precision farming, features a dynamic environment that elevates the principles of the Lewis signaling game. This unique setting serves as a testing ground for the advancement of robot-to-robot communication protocols.

Each problem set within Signal8 encompasses four distinct instances, with each one posing different constraints on the positioning of entities such as starting points, goals, and both static and dynamic obstacles. This dynamic feature fosters examination of communication strategies in diverse settings, enhancing the environment's realism and adaptability.

A notable characteristic of Signal8 is its incorporation of asymmetric information, whereby two types of agents â€“ an 'eye in the sky' agent with global information and ground agents with only local information â€“ operate simultaneously. This asymmetry replicates real-world situations, presenting challenges for the development of efficient communication strategies. It also provides intriguing prospects for the generation of context-dependent language and high-level directives.

In Signal8, both static and dynamic obstacles are present, creating further complexities for agents navigating through the environment. Static obstacles provide persistent barriers, while dynamic obstacles introduce predictable elements that can move or change over time. This complexity enriches the environment, making it an even more challenging and realistic platform for testing multi-agent communication strategies.
