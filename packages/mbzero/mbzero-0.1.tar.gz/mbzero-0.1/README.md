# mbzero: simple python bindings for Musicbrainz

mbzero is a simple library to provide bindings to the musicbrainz ws/2 API.

## License

The license is BSD-2 to give the maximum permission for hacking and sharing.

However, if one day we have a license that forbids AI exploration in commercial
use such as copilot, I may change the license.

## Requirements

This requires `python3`, `python-request`, `python-requests-oauthlib`

## Manual build/installation

Manual build and install requires `python-build` and `python-installer`

You can build the library using `python -m build` and install with `python -m
installer --dest=<destination>` or `python -m installer --prefix=<prefix>`.

## Contribute

Feel free to fork or contribute on
<https://gitlab.com/Louson/python-mbzero>. Issues and PR are welcome as much as
much I can support them.

I am not a good python developper. If you think it can be placed in better
hands, please ask.

## Test

Test the library with `pytest -v`
